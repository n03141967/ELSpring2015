I tried to use the wifi usb adapter but it isn't working. The Wifi adapter just refuse to work.
I use the ethernet cable to connect to the internet. 

To set up the wifi connection I verify the actives interfaces : sudo cat /etc/network/interface

and I configurate the file  /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with informations to connect to the SUNY network.
